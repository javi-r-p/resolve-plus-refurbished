# Resolve plus (refurbished)
Resolve plus (refurbished) is a web app for ticketing (a known ticketing system is OSTicket). It is thought to be used internally in a company for their users to issue tickets for their devices, or something they need, such as installing a new app.
\
\
The app allows the users to customize their settings, for example, to enable or disable notifications via e-mail. Other settings are dark mode and language. Users can only issue tickets. Everything else is responsibility of the technician.
\
\
On the other side, technicians can also set their language, create, view, edit and delete users, add, view, delete and edit devices, close tickets, view statistics, add or remove fields for issues, change global settings such as support emails or phone numbers and create, view, edit and delete technicians. Technicians are also able to upload documents in which they provide solutions for specific issues that took a long time to fix. These documents are only readable by technicians.
\
Technicians are assigned roles, which establish their permissions on the web app. A technician may only be able to watch everything, but not allowed to do any changes, they also may only be able to view and close issues, or they may be able to do everything.
\
\
The purpose of this app is to bring companies a fully free web app they can use to register issues. Although you don't need much time to install the app, you may want to use an installation script, which will be included in this repository.
